# ruote-beanstalk

Beanstalk extensions for [ruote](http://ruote.rubyforge.org) (a Ruby workflow engine).

[Beanstalk is a simple, fast, workqueue service](http://kr.github.com/beanstalkd/).

ruote-beanstalk provides two things, **first** a ParticipantProxy / Receiver pair, **second** a ruote storage implementation.

The ParticipantProxy / Receiver pair is about emitting workitems to a Beanstalk queue/tube and listening/receiving them back. Workers can connect to the Beanstalk queue, receive workitems, do some work and then (optionally) send the updated workitem back to the ruote system.

Ruote::Beanstalk::Storage is a storage implementation for ruote. Workers and engines can connect over Beanstalk to a shared storage.

The storage listens to a Beanstalk queue where it receives storage orders that it conveys to a FsStorage instance.

(Initially I tried to use Beanstalk for msgs and schedules as well, but since you can't delete a delayed message in Beanstalk (as of now), I fell back to using Beanstalk as middleware, it's slightly slower, but much simpler and robust).

## usage

### Ruote::Beanstalk::ParticipantProxy and Receiver

Registering a Beanstalk participant :

```ruby
  @engine.register_participant(
    'alpha',
    Ruote::Beanstalk::ParticipantProxy,
    'beanstalk' => '127.0.0.1:11300',
    'tube' => 'ruote-workitems')
```


Binding a listener to a storage or an engine :

```ruby
  Ruote::Beanstalk::Receiver.new(
    engine, '127.0.0.1:11300', 'tube' => 'ruote-incoming')

      # or

  Ruote::Beanstalk::Receiver.new(
    storage, '127.0.0.1:11300', 'tube' => 'ruote-incoming')
```

The receiver manages a thread that listens to incoming messages and feeds them to ruote via the engine or directly via a storage.


### Ruote::Beanstalk::Storage

There are two modes in which Storage can be used :

* bound to a remote storage (client)
* bound to the physical storage (server)

There should always be at least 1 server and 1 client.

Beanstalk is the intermediary.


#### client

Pass a string of the form host:port and a hash of options :

```ruby
  Ruote::Beanstalk::Storage.new('127.0.0.1:11300', opts)
```

Wrapped in an engine + worker :

```ruby
  engine = Ruote::Engine.new(
    Ruote::Worker.new(
      Ruote::Beanstalk::Storage.new('127.0.0.1:11300', opts)))
```

#### server

This piece of ruby starts a Beanstalk instance (:fork => true) and starts a BsStorage 'server' coupled to an embedded FsStorage :

```ruby
  require 'ruote/beanstalk'

  Ruote::Beanstalk::Storage.new(':11300', 'ruote_work', :fork => true)
```


## running tests

### Ruote::Beanstalk::ParticipantProxy and Receiver

Simply do

```
  ruby test/test.rb
```

in your ruote-beanstalk/ directory.


### Ruote::Beanstalk::Storage

assuming you have

```
  ruote/
  ruote-beanstalk/
```

In a separate terminal, go to ruote-beanstalk/ and launch

```
  ruby serve.rb
```

To launch a beanstalkd + fs storage couple, then run unit or functional tests


* unit tests :

get into ruote/ and do

```
  ruby test/unit/storage.rb -- --beanstalk
```

* functional tests :

get into ruote/ and do

```
  ruby test/functional/test.rb -- --beanstalk
```
