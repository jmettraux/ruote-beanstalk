  # This participant emits workitems towards a beanstalk queue.

  #
  # == workitem format
  #
  # Workitems are encoded in the format
  #
  #   [ 'workitem', workitem.to_h ]
  #
  # and then serialized as JSON strings.
  #
  #
  # == cancel items
  #
  # Like workitems, but the format is
  #
  #   [ 'cancelitem', fei.to_h, flavour.to_s ]
  #
  # where fei is the FlowExpressionId of the expression getting cancelled
  # (and whose workitems are to be retired) and flavour is either 'cancel' or
  # 'kill'.
  #
  #
  # == extending this participant
  #
  # Extend and overwrite encode_workitem and encode_cancelitem or
  # simply re-open the class and change those methods.
  #
  #
  # == :beanstalk
  #
  # Indicates which beanstalk to talk to

  # Most of the time, you want the workitems (or the cancelitems) to be
  # emitted over/in a specific tube
  #

  #     'tube' => 'ruote-workitems')
  #
  #
  # == :reply_by_default
  #
  # If the participant is configured with 'reply_by_default' => true, the
  # participant will dispatch the workitem over to Beanstalk and then
  # immediately reply to its ruote engine (letting the flow resume).
