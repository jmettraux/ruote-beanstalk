[o] operate : sign messages

[ ] operate : better name ?
[ ] 'commands' channel : better name ?
[ ] fork beanstalk S(d, 'iface:port', :fork => true)
    :beanstalkd => true is probably better

[ ] security issue in #serve (send)
[ ] put_back in the operate loop ?

[ ] test with beanstalk -b ruote_work/beanstalk/ or something

[ ] drop the msgs idiosyncrasies ?
    at first try to go all the way with msgs vs commands
    |
    one of the disadvantages of msgs + commands is that
    schedules are not stored at the same place as the exps/workitems/...

[ ] scheduled jobs : do not use delayed jobs
    maybe push everything to the commands channel/system
